Task 2: Predictive Modeling - Classifi cation
Description: Build a classifi cation model to predict outcomes based on a dataset (e.g., predicting if a customer will buy a product). This task covers data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using common classifi cation metrics.
Skills: Python, Scikit-Learn, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Classifi cation Metrics.
Objectives:
Preprocess the dataset, including data splitting, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Train a logistic regression and decision tree classifi er.
Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Choose the best model and summarize the evaluation in a report.
