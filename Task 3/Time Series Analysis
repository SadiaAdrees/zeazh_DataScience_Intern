Task 3: Time Series Analysis
Description: Analyze a time series dataset (e.g., stock prices, weather data) to detect trends, seasonality, and patterns. Apply time series forecasting techniques to predict future values.
Skills: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, ARIMA.
Objectives:
Preprocess the time series data (resampling, handling missing values).
Perform trend and seasonality analysis using visualization techniques.
Build a forecasting model using ARIMA or exponential smoothing.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and plot forecasted results.
