Task 4: Clustering for Customer Segmentation
Description: Use clustering to segment customers based on behavioral or demographic data. This task introduces unsupervised learning, focusing on grouping similar data points and visualizing clusters.
Skills: Python, Scikit-Learn, K-Means, PCA, Data Visualization.
Objectives:
Standardize and preprocess the dataset for clustering.
Apply K-Means clustering and determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
Visualize clusters in a 2D space using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
Analyze the characteristics of each cluster and interpret the results.
